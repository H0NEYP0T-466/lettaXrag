MANUAL STEPS NEEDED — READ THIS
=================================

If you previously created a Letta agent ("Isabella") using a non-longcat model
(e.g., cerebras, groq, mistral), the existing agent will still be configured to
use that model internally.  The code reuses agents by name, so the old model
config persists even after code changes.

TO FIX THE 401 ERRORS WITH NON-LONGCAT PROVIDERS:

1. Open the Letta server dashboard (usually http://localhost:8283)
2. Delete the existing "Isabella" agent
3. Restart the backend — a new agent will be created automatically using
   the longcat model (which is the correct behaviour)

Alternatively, you can call the reset endpoint or run this Python snippet
against your running Letta server:

    from letta_client import Letta
    client = Letta(base_url="http://localhost:8283")
    for agent in client.agents.list():
        if agent.name == "Isabella":
            client.agents.delete(agent.id)
            print(f"Deleted agent {agent.id}")

After deletion, the next chat message will automatically create a fresh
"Isabella" agent backed by the longcat model.  All other providers (Cerebras,
Groq, Mistral) will work because:

  - Letta always uses longcat internally for memory processing
  - The Letta context is injected as a system message to the actual provider
  - No 401 errors because the provider API keys are used directly by llm_service,
    not through the Letta server's BYOK registration

ALSO MAKE SURE YOUR .env FILE HAS VALID API KEYS:

    LONGCAT_API_KEY=your_longcat_key
    CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_cerebras_key
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
    MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_key
    LETTA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8283
